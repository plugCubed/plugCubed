###Developers###
plug&#179; invites other script developers on plug.dj to use our socket server.
By sharing the same socket server, we can all support shared backup chat system, in case of chatsplits.
Thereby all the users of the scripts that uses this server will still be able to talk to eachother.

Info about how to connect and communicate with the server will be up soon.

###Disclaimer###
This script connects to our own socket server.
This socket server makes it possible to have some of the features that plug&#179; contains.

The userdata sent to the socket server is your userid, username, roomid and version of plug&#179;.
All chat messages that you send is also sent to the socket server to act as a backup chat server.

None of the data sent to the socket server is saved.
As soon as you disconnect all your userdata is no longer existant on the socket server.

Every minute the socket server counts number of clients that are connected and saves that number for statistic purpose only.

This disclaimer can be changed without any notice but we promise we aren't doing anything to harm your informations.
